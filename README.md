# Welcome to my first project!

It's my take on a classic game of tic tac toe.

Hope you enjoy!

## Now Let's Get Technical

This game was made with JavaScript.

The logic behind the game is quite straight-forward:
- When user click on a space - it is marked with either O or X, changing every click.
- The winning conditions are checked after every move. That is, if there are three markers of a type that are in a line either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
- When there is no winner, **the board reset** and the game continues until there is a winner. Why settle for a draw when either of you can collapse or make a mistake in this seemingly never-ending game.
- When there is a winner, the background colour change depending on the winner. No, you cannot change the colour. I made it, I get to pick the colour.
- The code was made with minimum repetition (or so I thought). Have a peek at the code! Feedbacks are always welcome.
- I am not aware of any bugs/issues with the game at the time of writing. But then again I have been squashing bugs left and right in a caffeine-induced rampage for the past couple of hours so I might miss some. Let me know!
