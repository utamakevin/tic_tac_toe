### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** – Let's start out with something fun - a game! We'll be making **tic tac toe** (knots and crosses). What a nice surprise! But it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting approach to this classic game. 

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you've got!

### Timetable

* Submission & presentation on **Friday 2:05pm**

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between more than one player (2 player playing on a single computer)
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Design logic for a draw game** & **visually display when there is a draw**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables


* At least one artefact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe, mockup or storyboard demonstrating planning - **Due today** 
* A **working game, that can win, draw & lose, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and **frequent commits** dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Bonus extensions

These are for extra credit! DON'T focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* [ ] Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
* [ ] Allow game customizable options, game rounds, name & profiles, time limits, board size etc  
* [ ] Allow players to customize their token (X, O, name, picture, avatar etc)
* [ ] Get inventive with your styling - research CSS effects, animations to spiff things up
* [ ] **Research** **LocalStorage** or **SessionStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
* [ ] Use timers to display "waiting..." messages while users are waiting to be matched
* [ ] **Research** web audio API and add sound effects to your game
* [ ] Be creative! Bend the rules and give it a twist!

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, markup, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, debugger, etc) to debug and solve problems
* **think of a theme** for your game. having a theme makes it more interesting and can give you better vision.
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
